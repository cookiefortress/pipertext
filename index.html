                Pipertext is my love letter to the old web; a time when the net seemed to be an underground honey hole with a vast library of talented, creative people showing off the things they love. I was personally born too late to have seen it myself, but I nonetheless have grown very fond of the aesthetics and "society" of the time!

                The early web represented a <em>human</em> experience. It wasn't without its flaws, but what is? Compared to today, it seems so beautiful; pages handcrafted by people of all walks of life, showing off their interests, passions, and awesome websites. I've grown up in a world where the web is primarily accessed through social media; divisive content designed to keep you addicted is the name of the game. This site is my contribution to the fun & human-centric net!

                I've compiled <a href="resource/resource.html">lots of resources</a> if you're interested in making your website look like it's straight out of the Y2K era as well. Keep on puffing! :D
