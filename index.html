                The early Web was full of so many great things. It had character, being full of hardcore nerds making websites.
                Not many people <em>truly</em> knew what they were doing yet, and that's probably what made it so great. It was
                like the Web fostered a "culture" that went beyond geopolitical borders. Today, it really is a shell of its former
                self; it's very commercial, and creativity is frequently discouraged. Not many want to "explore" a website anymore.

                Pipertext is dedicated to rounding up resources related to the concept of Web 1.0. Everything from old styling guides and websites to current imitations of what the Web was over two decades ago (I hope you consider this website to be included in that group!).

                Despite not personally living through what I see as the best period of the Internet (I was born in 2004), I have a penchant for the aesthetics of that time, as well as what seemed like the far more wholesome community of netizens. My interest in Web development largely originates from Web 1.0 and its characteristics.
            </p>
            <p>
                It seems that today, Web 1.0 lives on in some ways. Websites such as <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neocities</a> carry on the torch of what once was a pinnacle of the old Web,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geocities</a>. Homegrown websites, whether styled in an old-school manner or not, are out there; the netizen simply must find them. I make an effort to link to these sites regardless of their aesthetics, but naturally the ones I know of tend to be similar to Pipertext.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you can find some use for the site. Many may find it weird to fixate on the Web designs of the past, but there really is something particularly cozy and warm about them. I'm sure that if you feel similar, some things around here will be useful to you!
