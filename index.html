                <h2>&gt; Welcome to Pipertext</h2>
                <p>The Web today is a boring place. It's full of uninspired design, propogated largely by
                    the corporations who have overtaken its existence. A once mesmerizing world of creativity
                    and novelty is now a lame dystopia, a mere pop-up simulator.

                    Here at Pipertext, the goal is to pay respects to the once beautiful Internet. Despite myself
                    not living through the so-called golden age, I have a penchant for the aesthetic and overall
                    "community" that once seemed to dwell these lands. This site is made with those days of old in mind.
