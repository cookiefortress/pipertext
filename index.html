                The early Web was full of so many great things. It had character, being full of hardcore nerds making websites.
                Not many people <em>truly</em> knew what they were doing yet, and that's probably what made it so great. It was
                like the Web fostered a "culture" that ascended geopolitical borders.

                Contrast this with the Internet of the 90s and 2000s, and I would hope you'll see we have
                lost much of the character that used to inhabit these lands. It used to mostly consist
                of personal sites, lovingly hand-made with the holy trinity of Web design. Now, everything
                seems like it's just some corporation. Articles suck, some borderline <em>impossible</em>
                to read without an adblocker. And everybody is at eachother's throats; not that such attitudes
                haven't been around on the net since its inception, but it seems like now it's worse
                than ever.

                Despite not personally living through what I see as the best period of the Internet (I was born
                in 2004), I have a penchant for the aesthetics and community of that time, and my interest in
                Web development originates there.

                Funnily enough, I don't believe the oldweb is dead. I think it's just a little deeper than the
                Facebooks and Amazons of today. Websites like Neocities are basically entirely devoted to the
                continuation of what the net once was. Plenty of people are still hosting their cool and unique
                websites, often with the aesthetics of the oldweb.
