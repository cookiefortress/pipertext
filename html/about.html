				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					Once I got out of high school and started up college, I always imagined having a website chock-full of old-school Web goodies, not just for myself, but for anyone with an interest in this bygone era. I'm still in college, studying computer science; I kept saying "not until I can create it efficiently," but what's the fun in that, anyways? It's supposed to be a little unoptimized, right?!

					Regardless, I've wanted a website with Web 1.0 aesthetics for as long as I can remember. Pictured on the left is one of my first decent attempts at doing so - a <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Ricochet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ricochet</a> (obscure game by Valve) fan/information page. Ricostay was never actually hosted, but it was a cute little way for me to practice a bit of design. If you couldn't tell yet, I absolutely love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consolas</a>.

					Pipertext is meant to be my love letter to the old Web. As is mentioned on the homepage, I was born in 2004. I unfortunately didn't get to experience the Net in its infancy. Most consider Web 1.0 to have "ended" in 2004, but it's really an arbitrary definition. Nonetheless, I was an Annoying Orange kid. I grew up knowing the Web in a way similar to what it is today: commercialized, and largely centralized, too.

				<p>
					The nerdy and more wholesome nature of the young Web is something I missed out on, but I strongly believe it can live on. We don't need to make this place so polarizing and patronizing, and we don't need to use the social media applications that encourage it. Today, the Web is seen as a negative thing, and it <em>often is</em>, but it doesn't need to be that way. It wasn't initially; don't get me wrong, there's three things you can't escape: death, taxes, and dickheads on the Internet. We can nonetheless work to support a more productive and positive community on the Web.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The goal is for Pipertext to reference, archive, and detail anything and everything related to the old Web. Designs, components, pictures/backgrounds, old websites that are still running, old websites that have been archived in some way, modern depictions of Web 1.0, and everything in between. Again, compiling a lot of this sort of information onto one website will be really interesting and helpful for me, but also, hopefully, for you.
				</p>
				<p>
					I enjoy modern depictions of the style about as much as authentic old ones. What I mean is that I also want to archive things I see as uplifting and innocent; perhaps these are not old websites, nor even modern websites made with the style in mind, just those that try to spread a positive message of some kind. To me, that seems in line with the aura of the pre-2010s Web, too.

				<h2>A Few Notes</h2>
				<p>
					Firstly, this website is designed desktop-first. As described above, I really dislike the polarizing nature of the current Web; I can only imagine the emails that will one day find themselves in my inbox due to a decision like that one. For the purposes of Pipertext, there's really not much reason to have amazing support on smaller screens. For me, anyways, I tend to find it easier to collapse a design than to expand it. Personal preference! I do make sure it's <em>legible</em>, but pretty? You be the judge! :-D
				</p>
				<p>
					Secondly, you'll notice that in the footer, I have only validated my CSS through W3C's website. Their HTML validator <strong>hates</strong> fun, and therefore <code>marquee</code> tags. So it won't pass Pipertext. Because I am stubborn, as well as a bit opinionated on whether or not HTML tags should be deprecated (don't break the Web), I utterly refuse to rid of my <code>marquee</code> tags. Sorry anti-fun dudes.
				</p>
				<p>
					I would love it if you sent any resources you think belong here my way. The <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> lists two email addresses you can contact me at.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because I am certain that the brave netizens who scour these lands will ask at some point: I do indeed actually smoke a pipe. I know society tends to lump all tobacco together now, and that may be for the best! It's not good for you. But I can assure you it is not addiction (I can quit any day I swear), and I do not inhale. :&#x29
