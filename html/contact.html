            There a couple of ways to get in contact with me, if you need to
            (for whatever reason that may be... I know my devilish looks can be
            mystifying).

            The first following email address is probably the most ideal way,
            but it really doesn't matter. It automatically forwards emails to my
            primary email. If you have any recommendations, questions, or
            comments otherwise, I will reply to you from my primary email
            address which is listed below as well.

            Yes, it's a Hotmail email address. No, I did not make it two decades
            ago when I was a fetus. I made it in 2025. I am tryharding the
            old-school aesthetic. Yes, I know I am super
