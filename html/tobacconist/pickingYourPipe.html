			<h2>Picking your pipe</h2>
			<h3 class="seriesHeaderSubtext">
				this article is a part of the <a href="/html/tobacconist/tobacconist.html">tobacconist</a> series
			</h3>
			<hr>
			<p id="seriesFirstPara">
				Howdy piper! In this article, I'm hoping to give a short debrief on picking your pipe. It can seem like
				a lot to pick out your first one looking at the sheer amount of options there are. And if you're
				anything like me, you'll have some Einstein-level questions such as:
			<ul>
				<li>How does a pipe made of wood not catch on fire?</li>
				<li>Who the hell first thought to make a pipe out of a corncob?</li>
				<li>How do I look out for ACME exploding pipes? Elmer warned me about those...</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Actually, I won't really be answering any of those. And anyways, what do you mean my briar pipes aren't
				supposed to double as a fireplace when I smoke with them? Nonetheless, I can certainly tell you how to
				get started with a fine smoking instrument!</p>
			<h2 id="sec1">What kinds of pipes are there?</h2>
			<p>At first, it may seem like there's a million different materials out of which pipes are made. But
				honestly, there's not very many:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Briar wood</li>
				<li>Hardwoods (cherry, pear, etc.)</li>
				<li>Morta (wood)</li>
				<li>Other woods (larch, ash)</li>
				<li>Corncob</li>
				<li>Meerschaum</li>
				<li>Clay</li>
				<li>Calabash</li>
				<li>Metal</li>
				<li>Miscellaneous novelties</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Any materials besides those listed above/below should warrant some caution when being used for making
				tobacco pipes. The most common material is, by far, briar. Despite my introduction, I will answer one of
				those questions: briar wood doesn't burn until it reaches around 1000 degrees Celsius. Also, hardwood
				used for pipes generally catches fire at around 600-700 degrees Celsisus. Smoking pipes usually reach
				around 500 degrees celsisus, depending on the cadence of the smoker.
			</p>
			<p>
				But which one is right for you? I won't provide too many external links in this article, as I just want
				to provide my general opinion on what will get the job done for you. I'll give some general price
				estimates and what pipe works best for what.
			</p>
			<h2 id="sec2">Briar pipes</h2>
			<p>
				Briar pipes are basically the gold standard, as much as it pains to me say that as a corncob elitist.
				They just work; they generally burn pretty cool, depending on the specific pipe. They're also quite
				varied in appearance; in terms of pipe shapes, there isn't one out there which isn't made with briar.
			<figure class='card'>
				<img src='/media/img/briarPipeEx.jpg' alt='An example of a briar pipe' />
				<figcaption>
					Example of a briar pipe
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			</p>
			<p>
				There's not really a downside to them, honestly. They're really quite durable compared to other
				materials. A briar pipe taking a fall may scuff it, but it's not going to render it unusable. It's
				also
				going to be hard to smoke so hot that you do any damage to them; try not to get that baby too hot,
				of
				course, but that applies to any pipe. Briars really are the jack-of-all-trades of the pipe world,
				and
				they may even be the master of some!
			</p>
			<p>
				The price of one will vary wildly. At a certain point, you're paying for craftsmanship, brand
				recognition, or other novelties. A <a
					href="https://www.pipesandcigars.com/category/shop-by-brand/dr-grabow/" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Grabow </a>
				will realistically smoke just as good as a Peterson, if not better, depending on your preferences.
				For a
				brand new, low-end briar, you can expect to pay $40-$50. Not too punishing, but certainly not the
				cheapest option, as we'll see later! Keep in mind that estate pipes (exquisite term for
				<em>used</em>
				pipes) are always cheaper than new ones, so long as you don't mind the idea of them. I've bought
				them
				and had good experiences, personally! No break-in required!
			</p>
			<h2 id="sec3">Hardwood pipes</h2>
			<p>
				The red-headed stepchild of pipe materials, hardwood is very underrated, in my opinion. It's most
				commonly found in lower-end <a href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipes/new/Missourimeerschaum/"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Missouri Meerschaum</a>
				pipes, but high-end hardwood pipes (which can be of varieties like strawberry or olive woods) are
				also
				plentiful. In my experience, these are amazing smokers, albeit I've only ever smoked ones sub-$30,
				so my
				experience isn't particularly broad, and I can't speak to the pricier ones.
				<figure class='card'>
				<img src='/media/img/hardwoodPipeEx.jpg' alt='An example of a hardwood (cherry wood) pipe' />
				<figcaption>
					Example of a hardwood pipe (cherry wood, in this case)
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			</p>
			<p>
				Hardwood pipes tend to be lighter compared to their briar friends, but this can vary wildly, being
				largely dependent on the density of the specific hardwood. In general, it would be safe to say that
				hardwood pipes offer an easier clenching experience. Yet, they are also more prone to scuffs from
				drops
				or knocking into things, especially given their lighter color will make those scuffs really shine.
			</p>
			<p>Hardwood pipes, as I mentioned above, vary in terms of price. I recommend picking up a Missouri
				Meerschaum one, they make various kinds like <a
					href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipes/new/Missourimeerschaum/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=573899"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a> (which I personally own) which are really
				great smokers. If you want a cheaper pipe but can't swallow the hillbilly aesthetics of corncob
				pipes,
				then these are the way to go. High-end hardwood pipes can run you into the $100+ price range,
				though!
			</p>
			<h2>Morta pipes</h2>
			<p>I will be honest: I had never heard of morta before working on this article page. Now that I know
				about
				it, though, my wallet feels a bit heavy... I think it could use some help with that...</p>
			<p>Morta wood (which is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog-wood" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">bog-wood</a> more generally) is a wood that has been buried in decayed
				vegetation for hundreds if not thousands of years. According to the Wikipedia article I linked,
				morta is
				basically wood in the early stages of fossilisation; leave it there for a few million extra years
				and
				it'll turn into coal.</p>
			<p> I'm no researcher, but from what I can tell, this wood offers some impressive durability, generally
				preferable even to briar. It is extremely heat-resistant, and also very beautiful; the patterns are
				absolutely gorgeous, and I love the natural grey color it often presents.</p>
			<p>Surprisingly, these aren't the priciest things in the world; <a
					href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipes/new/Chacom/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=676083" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">here's one</a> that'll run you around the $150 dollar
				range. Probably not
				the best option if you're just starting out, but they're cool to know about, not only for their use
				in
				pipes but also in general. And the name is badass. Bog-wood.</p>
			<h2>Other woods</h2>
			<p>There's various other woods that are often used in pipes. I won't go too into detail here, but here's
				an
				<a href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipes/new/Rattrays/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=679967" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">ash wood pipe</a> and here's a <a
					href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipes/new/vauen/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=676750" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">larch wood pipe</a>. These are pretty pricey, and
				similar to morta pipes,
				probably aren't the best option if you're just starting out. If you become invested in the hobby,
				I'm
				sure these make for cool pieces in the ol' collection, and probably great smokers too.
			</p>
			<h2>Corncob pipes</h2>
			<p>
				The holy grail of pipes, corncobs can do no wrong. Cool smoking <em>and</em> cool looking,
				affordable
				yet durable, and utterly stylish. There's simply nothing more classy than a corncob pipe.
			<figure class='card'>
				<img src='/media/img/corncobPipeEx.jpg'
					alt='An example of a corncob pipe' />
				<figcaption>
					Example of a corncob pipe
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			</p>
			<p>
				Maybe I'm exaggerating a bit. Most people wouldn't call it the "holy grail". I just figured I'd let
				you
				know of my biases ahead of time. Even though I'm right. But seriously, the above points are mostly
				correct, apart from the last one which is up for debate. Personally, I've never thought corncob
				pipes
				look bad. I think they look cool, and they make <a
					href="https://www.thecountrysquireonline.com/product/missouri-meerschaum-country-squire-bing/"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ones that don't resemble a corncob </a>anyways.
			</p>
			<p>
				The big plus for these is that they're not only cheap, but pretty damn durable, and hard to break. I
				have <a href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipes/new/Missourimeerschaum/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=669881"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this cob</a>, and it's my primary smoker. I've dropped
				it,
				banged it into crap, and I smoke pretty hot so it's taken a beating on that front too. It's my best
				smoker; better than my Peterson, and better than my Rossi, to me. I can't vouch for cobs enough.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nonetheless, I can understand that some perhaps can't get past the aesthetics of it. Even with
				stained
				cobs with are brown, black, or another less corncob-esque color, I would be above my head to say
				that I
				might feel a bit ridiculous smoking out of certain pipes myself. However, if that's no issue for
				you,
				then cobs all the way for your first smokin' pipe!
			</p>
			<p>
				I recommend checking out the <a href="https://corncobpipe.com/product-category/smoking-pipes/cobs/"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Missouri Meerschaum website</a> and just taking a look
				around at what they have. The prices listed are sometimes beat by vendors, but their website has the
				most exhaustive selection of pipes. Their cobs range from sub-$10 to $50+, but you're mostly paying
				for
				visuals and larger bowl sizes at higher price ranges. If you're lucky, you'll catch them when
				they're
				selling packs of seven blemished pipes for around $50!
			</p>
			<p>
				A note of warning; I wouldn't buy corncob pipes from basically anyone besides Missouri Meerschaum.
				They're likely made with dubious materials in foreign nations for very cheap, and with very cheap
				labor.
				Missouri Meerschaum pipes are cheap enough to warrant never buying something any cheaper. You may
				wonder
				why I'm implying they're the only corncob pipe company around, and that's because they basically
				are.
				There's also <a href="https://corncobpipe.com/old-dominion-corn-cob-and-clay-pipes/" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">Old Dominion</a>, but that's a bit of a moot point as they are owned
				by
				Missouri Meerschaum! Truthfully, all of the other cob companies were ran out of business sometime in
				the
				last century or two. There's some small vendors that make handmade corncob pipes (usually found on
				Etsy
				and the like), but other than them, stay skeptical!
			</p>
			<h2>Meerschaum</h2>
			<p>As of writing this article, I don't own a meerschaum pipe. I've never even tried one; but I can still
				tell you what I know!
			<figure class='card'>
				<img src='/media/img/meerschaumPipeEx.jpg' alt='An example of a meerschaum pipe' />
				<figcaption>
					Example of a meerschaum pipe
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			</p>
			<p>
				Their primary advantage is that they are very porous, which means a lot of the moisture and
				tarcontent
				are drawn into stone rather than into your mouth. Not necessarily a "safer" smoke, but many argue
				that
				it enhances the flavor. It also doesn't burn, period; they offer a very heat-resistant smoke.
			</p>
			<p>
				The thing with a lot of the meerschaum pipe market is that you either love them or hate them; check
				<a href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipes/new/AKB/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=612686" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> out for an example. Don't get me wrong, anyone can tell you
				that
				handmade beauties like this are works of art and a really cool display of craftsmanship, but I will
				tell
				you personally that I wouldn't want to smoke out of it! Not only for fear of damaging it, but also
				because I do find it slightly corny. But who the hell am I? If you dig 'em, buy 'em! They make
				plenty of
				them which aren't shaped like faces, ships, or whatever, as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				Their weight can vary, depending on how hard the meerschaum is pressed, and the variety of
				meerschaum.
				In general, though, they aren't as heavy as they may look in pictures.
			</p>
			<p>
				These pipes do tend to run on the pricier side, so these aren't the best option for a new piper.
			</p>
			<h2>Clay</h2>
			<p>Perhaps the most impractical of the options thus far. If you think a corncob pipe makes you look
				old-timey, well, look again.
			<figure class='card'>
				<img src='/media/img/clayPipeEx.jpg' alt='An example of a clay pipe' />
				<figcaption>
					Example of a clay pipe
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			</p>
			<p>
				For reference, <a
					href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipes/new/clay-pipes/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=336117"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> is a pretty typical clay pipe. They come in
				other
				colors of course, like white or brown. Some have clay bowls while still having metal and plastics on
				the
				shank and stem.
			</p>
			<p>
				Clay pipes are unique, and they're not for everyone. For starters, don't drop them. Or hit them off
				anything. Or look at them. Because they're fragile, and they will break! They also smoke
				<em>very</em>
				hot; even the slowest piper in the world will burn the shit out of their hand at the touch of one of
				these bad boys.
			</p>
			<p>
				The benefit is that they require no break-in period, and are completely neutral in terms of flavor;
				that
				is, unlike cobs and briars, you probably won't sense the pipe itself imparting any sort of its
				natural
				flavor into your tobacco. You also look cool. But you look cool with every pipe, let's be honest.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have the exact clay pipe linked above. They really are not punishing price-wise, but as with most
				of
				the other materials I've already talked about, they can get pricey for the higher-end stuff. They're
				cheap enough to warrant a purchase of one, even if it's just to look cool on the ol' pipe cabinet.
				Probably not the best beginner pipe, but if you're into the aesthetic I say go for it. Just do
				beware:
				don't burn your fingers into tiny puddles of human ash.
			</p>
			<h2>Calabash</h2>
			<p>
				Calabash pipes are some of the most interesting out there, in my opinion. Do note: <i>calabash</i>
				can
				refer non-calabash pipes that are simply shaped like actual calabash pipes, <a
					href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipes/new/peterson/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=687924"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like this</a>.
				<figure class='card'>
				<img src='/media/img/calabashPipeEx.jpg' alt='An example of a calabash pipe' />
				<figcaption>
					Example of a calabash pipe
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
				</p>
					<p>Allow me to level with you here, and
				say
				that I cannot find a single one from a reputable retailer that I'd feel safe linking to here.
				They're
				novel little pieces, especially if you can find one, apparently. They were more commonplace in olden
				times, when the pipe market was much bigger. It seems there's plenty that are made but still use a briar or meerschaum chamber, but in terms of pure calabash, I didn't have much luck. It's easy to find pictures of others' antique ones on various forums though.
			</p>
			<h2>Metal</h2>
			<p>
				I will come out swinging here; metal makes for a dogshit pipe. I have smoked out of approximately
				one,
				and while it was the price of a low-end corncob pipe, my expectations were pulled down from the
				ceiling
				and slammed through the ground so hard that they gave a quick greeting to Satan on the way down. No
				flavor, burns hot as shit, and generally just feels cheap. You'll probabyl only find these in little
				tobacco shops for dirt cheap. I imagine these are more for the Devil's lettuce rather than any
				tobacco,
				and even then, use something classier!
			</p>
			<p>Just to clarify, I am not talking about <a
					href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipes/new/falcon/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=565669" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">Falcon pipes</a>, which are pipe stems that you can
				buy interchangeable
				bowls to use with. Falcon makes neat pipes that are beloved by pipers all over. The problem is
				specifically with metal bowls/chambers, where the tobacco is being burnt.</p>
			<h2>Novelty materials</h2>
			<p>At the end of the day, a pipe can be <em>made</em> out of anything. That doesn't mean that a pipe <em>should</em> be made out of anything, but it's a big world, with billions of us in it; people have just about tried everything! You can check out <a href="https://pipedia.org/wiki/Materials_and_Construction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page on Pipedia</a> which goes a bit more in-depth regarding the different materials used in pipes, but I'll also briefly go over some of them below.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the Pipedia page linked just above, it provides a mostly exhaustive list of the woods you can easily find pipes made with. Note that it appears to be missing some, like ash wood. For some reason, I am an absolute sucker for pipes made of unique woods. It makes my briars just seem so boring when I could be smoking out of some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combretum_imberbe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leadwood!</a> (wait, lead..???)
			</p>
			<p>
				Pipes have been <a href="https://pipedia.org/wiki/Meissen_Porcelain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made out of porcelain</a>, although it seems they are more of an antique now. I can only imagine how hot these suckers get, and I can also only imagine the amount of shit that would run down my leg if I dropped it on my foot. A quick google search showed some people selling handmade ones, if that piques your interest at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				Stone is another one. Yep, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catlinite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stone.</a> They <a href="https://www.pipekeepers.org/store/c16/Pipes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still make them</a>, too, although it looks like the chambers are quite narrow. I believe these are intended to be historically accurate, and Native Americans did not smoke their tobacco like people do now; it was (as far as I'm aware) entirely for ceremonial purposes in most cases. Thus, they didn't need a large chamber.
			</p>
			<p>Well, there's certainly others, but given this was just supposed to be an introduction to pipes for the novice piper, I may have overextended my reach a bit. I hope you were able to get some value out of this! As always, any errors or suggestions you have, send them my way on the <a href="/index.html#contact">contact page</a>!</p>
