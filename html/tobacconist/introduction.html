				Howdy piper! If you've made it here, I would imagine you've developed an interest in the smoking of
				delightful leaves. Whether you just want to learn about the history and practice or actually want to
				start puffing up smoke, you've come to a good spot.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will make sure to provide lots of links to other websites for further reading throughout this page.
			</p>
			<h2 id="sec1">What is pipe smoking?</h2>
			<p>A good portion of people today see pipe smoking as an old-timey, perhaps even antiquated method of
				smoking tobacco. In fact, I'd wager some people don't even realize that so many people are still piping
				to this day.</p>
			<p>Pipe tobacco may be more of a rarity, but it's nonetheless a surprisingly large industry to this day.
				According to the NIH, <a href='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11719056/#f0001' target='_blank'
					rel='noopener noreferrer'>pipe tobacco makes up .9% of the tobacco industry</a>. Yeah, I know, that
				seems <small>tiny</small>, but it really isn't bad; consider that cigarettes are in the obvious lead,
				and the cigars/cigarillos section, sitting at around 14%, is inclusive of products like <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backwoods_Smokes" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">Backwoods</a>. Given that pipe tobacco is more of a hobby than a habit
				(cigarettes!), the numbers aren't too punishing. The industry is still many dozens of millions of
				dollars large!</p>
			<p>But enough of all that! What does pipe smoking <em>entail?</em> Well, for starters, it's a ritual. It's
				like baking homemade cookies versus buying some from the store. With pipes, you have to pack the tobacco
				just right, light it carefully, tamp the ash, and clean your pipe, among other things. It is nothing
				like smoking a cigarette; it's a more delicate process which yields to you great taste and enjoyment.
				And in the spirit of that, it is very customizable. Choosing your preferred pipe
				shapes and finding your favorite tobaccos is the fun part!</p>
			<p>The bare minimum you'll need for smoking a pipe is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A pipe</li>
				<li>Some pipe tobacco</li>
				<li>A lighter</li>
				<li>A tamper (somewhat optional, and this can be anything; a plastic/paint-free golf tee, for example)
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The tamper is simply for pushing down the ash as you smoke. Doing this is important! If you don't, you
				can end up burning your tongue, and your tobacco will get used up quicker. I'll go over all four of
				these items in the sections below.</p>
			<p>A high-level process of actually smoking your pipe is as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fill the pipe with tobacco. Not too tight, not too light. Get it just right!</li>
				<li>Perform a false light. Basically, burn the tobacco on the top. Don't put the flame directly to the
					tobacco, instead hover the flame above it while puffing, then tamp it back down.</li>
				<li>Now do the true light, same idea, except this time you're lighting the pipe with the intention of
					keeping it going. There's still no need to place the flame directly in the tobacco!</li>
				<li>You should be good to enjoy your pipe! Need to relight is perfectly normal, as is doing numerous
					false lights before you get going.</li>
				<li>Tamp the ash down periodically throughout your smoke! I like to do what's called a "gravity tamp"; I
					don't push down so much as I let gravity take my tamper as far down as it wishes.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="sec2">Picking your pipe</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="https://pipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_Shapes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img
						src="/media/img/pipeShapes.png" alt="Depiction of various tobacco pipe shapes"
						style="float: right; width: 270px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-left: 1rem;"></a>
				Pipes come in <a href="https://pipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_Shapes" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">many shapes and sizes</a>. There's pros and cons to a lot of them, but it
				truthfully comes down to an individual piper's preferences. For example, I have a penchant for
				churchwardens, which are depicted in the adjacent image in the middle of the third row from the bottom.
				I like a long stem because it keeps smoke out of my face and long hair. I have pipes of many shapes
				though; one which is a diplomat, and is very easy to clench between my teeth. One may prefer pokers
				because they're designed to be set down on a table, or a vestpocket because they like to smoke on the
				go. It's a wide, wide world of pipe shapes out there, and it all comes down to personal preference.
				Never let anybody tell you there are rules to this hobby; what you like is what you like! What "rules"
				there may be is a topic for another time, but those are mostly in the spirit of minimizing the health
				effects of pipe smoking as much as we can. In terms of pipe shapes, your choice should really just come
				down to
				what looks the coolest, and what you think you'll be the most comfortable holding/clenching.
			</p>
			<h2 id="sec3">Finding the finest leaf</h2>
			<p>While picking your pipe is fun, I must say that there's nothing quite like searching for your favorite
				tobacco blends. At the end of the day, a cheap-as-dirt Missouri Meerschaum corncob pipe sitting around
				$10 will perform just as good <em>if not better </em> than our fancy-dancy briar pipes. What you're
				often paying for there is craftmanship and specific aesthetics. While I can fawn all day about the
				coolest pipe shapes, the reason you get that pipe is to stuff some tobacco in the chamber!</p>
			<p>For starters, maybe take a look at <a href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/tobacco/" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">Smokingpipes' tobacco selection</a>. This isn't an ad, it just happens to
				be the site I tend to order from. Looking through what they have will get you a general idea of pipe
				tobacco's many forms. It may come in a tin, or a tub, or a pouch. Some are ordered in bulk. You have
				numerous varities of leaf, which are generally mixed together in a single "blend".</p>
			<p>I'm not going to get into the nitty-gritty of the differences between burley
				tobacco and virginia tobacco here, for example, but each variety is quite distinct. The real outlier
				that warrants
				some discussion is <a
					href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/smokingpipesblog/single.cfm/post/closer-look-aromatic-pipe-tobacco"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aromatic tobacco</a>. Basically, aromatic blends are
				"flavored", usually with stuff such as alcohol (think whiskey or bourbon), fruit, vanilla, or virtually
				anything else. A personal pick of mine is <a
					href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipe-tobacco/dan-tobacco/devils-holiday-50g/product_id/23141"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devil's Holiday</a>. You may encounter some elitism when
				it comes to these, but generally, a respectable piper will know that aromatics are just another spice in
				the pipe life!</p>
			<p>The reason I bring up aromatics is simply because they do tend to offer a pretty different experience, in
				terms of flavor, compared to non-aromatics. But the line between them is thin; sometimes, blends are
				topped with some kind of flavoring that may be so subtle that it isn't really discernible. Don't put all
				your eggs in one basket, try out an aromatic that's flavored with something you personally enjoy, and
				then try something like an English blend.</p>
			<p>Blends can vary in many ways besides flavor, too. Moisture levels, for example, can range from bone dry
				to straight up goop. Goopy ones tend to more readily bite your tongue; truth be told, though, I never
				bother with setting out tobacco to dry, but it is a common strategy for getting rid of some moisture.
			</p>
			<h2 id="sec4">Lighting up</h2>
			<p>Basically any soft flame lighter will be good. I strongly recommend you do <em>not</em> use a torch
				lighter, like you may see someone light cigars with. The flame is far too aggressive, and can diminish
				flavor. It also pushes heat much further down than a soft flame, which effectively wastes a bit of
				tobacco. Unless it was somehow the only lighter you had, try not to use one!</p>
			<p>I personally use a BIC lighter. Cheap and easy. You don't have to worry about dropping them and they last
				a while. I get <a
					href="https://www.amazon.com/BIC-Pocket-Lighter-Special-Lighters/dp/B0DQM3X2TL?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&gQT=1"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-black ones</a> which are quite stylish!</p>
			<p>Zippos also work. I have a couple with pipe inserts; I don't generally use them as I find I can taste the
				lighter fluid throughout the entire smoke when I light up with them. Some people say they can, some say
				they can't; the same dilemma happens among cigar smokers. If you have one laying around, you might as
				well give it a go!</p>
			<p>Matches are another option which I occasionally go with. You don't need anything fancy; Walmart sells <a
					href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Diamond-Green-Light-Strike-On-Box-Matches-10-Matchboxes-32-Matches-Each/17756645?classType=VARIANT&athbdg=L1102"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these</a> which are generally very cheap. If you're
				smoking outside, however, do be warned that matches are a horrible match (hehe) for a windy day!</p>
			<p>The last option is something like an <a href="https://imcorona.com/product/64-8306/" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">IM Corona</a>. These are expensive lighters, made in Japan. You'll
				probably only end up with these if pipe smoking becomes a big hobby for you; otherwise, it's probably
				not worth the price, and even if you do pipe smoke a lot, a clumsy individual (such as myself) is not a
				good caretaker for a lighter like that!</p>
			<h2 id="sec5">Pipe tools</h2>
			<p>Pipe tools are technically optional, but they do make the piping experience a lot easier. Check out the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia
					page on pipe tools</a> and look at the pictures for a good example of what they usually look like.
			</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/accessories/pipe-tampers-and-tools/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=576535"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This</a> is the typical run-of-the-mill pipe tool you'll
				probably see most often, and they're called "czech pipe tools". They're damn cheap! The little
				spoon/scooper is for getting the ash out of your pipe when you're done smoking, the "tamping foot" (the
				one with the surface turned 90 degrees at the end) is for tamping the ash down periodically throughout
				smoking, and the "dottle pick" (the pointy one) is for picking out pieces of tobacco/ash that get stuck
				at the bottom of the chamber. I also like to use it for scraping out the chamber's walls every dozen
				smokes or so.</p>
			<h2 id="sec6">Other useful stuff</h2>
			<p><a href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/accessories/pipe-cleaners-and-cleaning-supplies/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=725"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pipe cleaners</a> are an absolute must for any piper.
				Honestly, they should somewhere in your cabinet regardless of whether you smoke a pipe or not, because
				their uses reach far beyond cleaning pipes! Anyways, these soft cloth-sticks just slide into your pipe
				and pick up debris and wipe away condensation. You'll want longer ones depending on the size of your
				pipe; they make <a
					href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/accessories/pipe-cleaners-and-cleaning-supplies/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=5421"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">churchwarden pipe cleaners</a> specifically for pipes of
				longer stature, as well as a middle-ground <a
					href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/accessories/pipe-cleaners-and-cleaning-supplies/moreinfo.cfm?product_id=328251"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nine-inch version</a>. They're also made in varying levels
				of "strength", i.e. sharper bristles, but they can potentially scratch up the inside of your pipe.
				Personally, I stick with the soft ones, which are the ones I linked above.</p>
			<p>If you plan on clenching your pipe so your hands can be free, you can buy <a
					href="https://softybits.com/collections/pipe-products/products/softy-small-medium-and-large-rubber-tobacco-pipe-bits-bundle-14-pc-pack-of-each-size"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these Softy bits</a> which make it much easier on your jaw
				and teeth. In the long term, clenching a lot could end up doing some damage, so these aren't a horrible
				idea, especially if you have a heavy pipe.</p>
			<h2 id="sec7">Caring for your pipe</h2>
			<p><img src="/media/img/pipeAnatomy.png" alt="A diagram showing the parts of a tobacco pipe" width="300"
					style="float: right; margin: 1rem 0 1rem 1rem;">I made the world's greatest diagram, pictured
				adjacent to this paragraph, for your visual pleasure. It outlines the basic components of a pipe; note
				the difference between the chamber and the bowl. The bowl is the entire U-shape (in other cases,
				square-shape, or round-shape, or whatever) while the chamber is specifically the area where tobacco is
				placed.</p>
			<p>Caring for your pipe is really not very complex. Of course, if you have a very pricey pipe, you probably
				want to keep it clean and pretty, but for a cob or other cheap briar, it's really just a matter of
				running a pipe cleaner through it every so often and scraping out the chamber here and there. If you
				were just starting out, you'll probably be smoking out of something in the sub-$50 range, so pipe
				cleaners and a bit of scraping will go a long way. Polishing the outside of the pipe is something you
				can do too, usually with something like <a
					href="https://vermontfreehand.com/product/brebbia-pipe-and-stem-polish/" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="sec8">The end!</h2>
			<p>Pipe smoking is a badass thing, man. Whether you're a piper or not, one would need a damn strong argument
				to claim that a pipe in the mouth doesn't make a person look approximately forty-two times cooler.</p>
			<p>If you're just looking to get started, here would be my personal recommendations (all linked to on the
				same website, but can be purchased elsewhere):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Any <a style="text-decoration: none; color: var(--accentOne)"
						href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipes/new/Missourimeerschaum/" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">corn cob pipe</a></li>
				<li>Peterson is one of the most popular tobacco brands out there. I'd go with one of their lighter
					blends like <a style="text-decoration: none; color: var(--accentOne)"
						href="https://www.smokingpipes.com/pipe-tobacco/peterson/early-morning-pipe-50g/product_id/346525"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Morning Pipe</a>. This shouldn't buzz you to the
					point of puking like some people have dealth with numerous times. Not me though. Never me. I swear
					dude.</li>
				<li>Any lighter you have around. A standard BIC will do just fine!</li>
				<li>Any Czech pipe tool, or a golf tee. Make sure it's a wooden one, not plastic or paint-dipped.
					Puffing up that is... not good.</li>
			</ul>
