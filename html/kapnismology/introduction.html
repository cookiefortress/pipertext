				Howdy piper! If you've made it here, I would imagine you've developed an interest in the smoking of
				delightful leaves. Whether you just want to learn about the history and practice or actually want to
				start puffing up smoke, you've come to a good spot.

				I will make sure to provide lots of links to other websites for further reading throughout this page.

			<h2>What is pipe smoking?</h2>
			<p>A good portion of people today see pipe smoking as an old-timey, perhaps even antiquated method of
				smoking tobacco. In fact, I'd wager some people don't even realize that so many people are still piping
				to this day.</p>
			<p>Pipe tobacco may be more of a rarity, but it's nonetheless a surprisingly large industry to this day.
				According to the NIH, <a href='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11719056/#f0001' target='_blank'
					rel='noopener noreferrer'>pipe tobacco makes up .9% of the tobacco industry</a>. Yeah, I know, that
				seems <small>tiny</small>, but it really isn't bad; consider that cigarettes are in the obvious lead,
				and the cigars/cigarillos section, sitting at around 14%, is inclusive of products like <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backwoods_Smokes" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">Backwoods</a>. Given that pipe tobacco is more of a hobby than a habit
				(cigarettes!), the numbers aren't too punishing. The industry is still many dozens of millions of
				dollars large!</p>
			<p>But enough of all that! What does pipe smoking <em>entail?</em> Well, for starters, it's a ritual. It's
				like baking homemade cookies versus buying some from the store. With pipes, you have to pack the tobacco
				just right, light it carefully, tamp the ash, and clean your pipe, among other things. It is nothing
				like smoking a cigarette; it's a more delicate process which yields to you great taste and enjoyment
				when done correctly. And in the spirit of that, it is very customizable. Choosing your preferred pipe
				shapes and finding your favorite tobaccos is the fun part!</p>
			<h2>Picking your pipe</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="https://pipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_Shapes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/res/img/pipeShapes.png" alt="Depiction of various tobacco pipe shapes" style="float: right; width: 270px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-left: 1rem;"></a>
				Pipes come in <a href="https://pipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_Shapes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many shapes and sizes</a>. There's pros and cons to a lot of them, but it truthfully comes down to an individual piper's preferences. For example, I have a penchant for churchwardens, which are depicted in the adjacent image in the middle of the third row from the bottom. I like a long stem because it keeps smoke out of my face and long hair. I have pipes of many shapes though; one which is a diplomat, and is very easy to clench between my teeth. One may prefer pokers because they're designed to be set down on a table, or a vestpocket because they like to smoke on the go. It's a wide, wide world of pipe shapes out there, and it all comes down to personal preference. Never let anybody tell you there are rules to this hobby; what you like is what you like! What "rules" there may be, I will get into later, but those are mostly in the spirit of minimizing the health effects of pipe smoking as much as we can. In terms of pipe shapes, your choice should really just come down to what looks the coolest, and what you think you'll be the most comfortable holding/clenching.</p>
				<h2>Finding the finest leaves</h2>
				<p>While picking your pipe is fun, I must say that there's nothing quite like searching for your favorite tobacco blends. At the end of the day, a cheap-as-dirt Missouri Meerschaum corncob pipe sitting around $10 will perform just as good <em>if not better </em> than our fancy-dancy briar pipes. What you're often paying for their is craftmanship and more specific aesthetics. While I can fawn all day about the coolest pipe shapes, the reason you get that pipe is to stuff some tobacco in the chamber!</p>
