					<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
				</div>
			</section>

			<p>The dawn of the web was defined by raw HTML. No fancy colors, no animations, no React + Express SPAs with
				externally hosted databases... just pure, unadulterated text, some
				text bigger than other text, which often linked to other text. Everything was text. Need an
					example?

				</figure>

			<p>
				And that's all that it is. Any page rendered with exclusively HTML will look just like that. Below
				this paragraph is what this page looks like with no CSS. Keep in mind
				that HTML was birthed in a time where the web was expected to be used mostly by scientists &
				researchers; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TimBL</a> (the creator of HTML and the World Wide Web) certainly didn't
				expect that HTML would be the foundation powering giant websites like Amazon in the future.

				</figure>

			<p>If you're reading this article, that's might all be stuff you don't really care about anyways. My point
				is that HTML is deceptively simple. It wasn't designed to be anything
				fancy, and it certainly isn't. I would say you can get completely comfortable with HTML in a day.
				Mastering it may take, like, a couple days, man.</p>

			<h2>The basics</h2>

			<p>HTML at a high-level is just a bunch of tags that describe the content they contain. Some have content in within two tags, others don't. Here's an example of the former:</p>

			<code class="codeBlock">&lt;p&gt;Pipertext fuckin' rules!&lt;/p&gt;</code>

			<p>Take note of the tags before and after the text, and also know that <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> stands for
				"paragraph". The first tag is the opening tag. It lets the browser know, "hey,
				a paragraph starts here." The second tag (and final tag for this particular paragraph element) tells the
				browser that the paragraph is now complete. Everything in-between
				these tags is the text that makes up the paragraph.</p>

			<p>The second kind of tag is called a "void tag" to differentiate it from standard, non-void tags. A void
				tag only has one tag, the opening tag, and does not need to be closed.
				A fine example is the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag:</p>

			<code class="codeBlock"> &lt;img src='/images/pipertextLogo.png' alt='The Pipertext logo'&gt; </code>

			<p>An image doesn't need a closing tag, because the image itself is referenced as an attribute within the
				<code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. But what is an attribute?
			</p>

			<h3>Attributes</h3>

			<p>You'll notice I actually have two attributes in the above <code> &lt;img&gt; </code> tag. One is
				<code>src</code>, which tells the browser where to find the desired image;
				obviously, "src" stands for "source". If I changed this attribute's value to something like
				"epicCookie.png" and there was a picture of an epic cookie at the file path
				specified, then it would show that instead.
			</p>

			<p>The second attribute is <code>alt</code> which is short for "alternate text". Alternate text is used in
				two cases: when the image is unable to be retrieved from the server,
				and when someone is using a tool which reads it off to them automatically (which may be you..!). This is
				usually in the case of visually impaired individuals who may have
				a hard time seeing an image normally, so they depend on the alternate text being read out to them.</p>

			<p>These two attributes demonstrate the use of attributes as a whole. They provide additional information
				regarding the element they are found in. Do note that, in the case
				of non-void tags, attributes are <em>always</em> found within the opening tag. Closing tags are always
				just that, closing tags.</p>

			<h2>Types of elements</h2>

			<p>There exists somewhere in the ballpark of 110 HTML elements overall. The reason there isn't a concrete
				number is that browsers choose to implement very new or very niche
				elements on their own accord, and many old, sometimes browser-specific elements such as
				<code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> are still around despite being considered "deprecated" by
				all major browsers. The primary tags that you'll make us of frequently in your webpage-crafting career
				are universally supported.
			</p>

			<p>I like to group HTML tags like the following:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Text-level elements, like for headings and paragraphs</li>
				<li>Graphic elements, stuff like images and horizontal rules</li>
				<li>Semantic elements, tags which define things like "this is the main section"</li>
				<li>Metadata elements, which relay information related to the page, like associated files or keywords
				</li>
				<li>Obsolete elements, sometimes fun to use but generally obscure/not practical</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I feel that these categories mostly sum up what you have to work with. Text-level elements are like
				<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, which defines a simple paragraph. Headings are
				like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, and so forth. One of my
				favorites (which you may notice I am using liberally on this page)
				is <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, which designates the contained text as being a code segment of some kind.
				Most browsers will apply a monospace font to text found within a
				<code>&lt;code&gt;</code> element.
			</p>

			<p>Graphic elements are like the aforementioned <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, or stuff like
				<code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> which simply defines a horizontal line. Semantic
				elements include not only stuff like <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> (used to indicate the main content of a
				page) and
				<code>&lt;time&gt;</code> (used to indicate that the
				contained text is depicting time), but also stuff like <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> which offer
				functionality as well as indicating what the element actually is. Metadata
				elements, which I have yet to discuss, are stuff like <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>. Here's an example of
				one of those for clarity:
			</p>

			<code class="codeBlock">&lt;link href='/style.css' rel='stylesheet'&gt;</code>

			<p>This line of code tells the browser that there is a CSS stylesheet (which will add formatting, colors,
				layout changes, et cetera) related to this page, hence the
				<code>rel</code> attribute (short for "relation"), and where to find this stylesheet, hence the
				<code>href</code> attribute. Think of these as data
				<em>about</em> the webpage, rather than data <em>for</em> the webpage to use and display directly. I
				won't get into obsolete elements too much, but it's stuff like the
				aforementioned <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag, which is <em>not</em> an HTML standard and will work
				differently and sporadically across different browsers. Websites
				like Pipertext are commonly quite fond of these, as they do represent the fun, Wild West vibe of the
				oldweb, distinct from today's strict standards and lack of fun stuff
				like <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>.

			<p><a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements' target='_blank'
					rel=noopener noreferrer'>MDN</a> and
				<a href='https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp' target='_blank'
					rel='noopener noreferrer'>W3Schools</a> both have extensive lists of the most commonly used HTML
				elements. I'd say give them a scroll and see what's out there!

			<h2>What do I do with this wisdom?</h2>

			<p>Below is an example of some HTML in action. Study it deeply, young one...</p>

			<code class="codeBlock">
&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
		&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;pipertext&lt;/title&gt;
		&lt;link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/media/img/pipe.png"&gt;
		&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css"&gt;
		&lt;script src="/scripts/typewriter.js" type="module" defer=""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;header&gt;
			&lt;h1&gt;pipertext&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;h2&gt;welcome to the embernet&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;/header&gt;
		&lt;main&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life. Pipertext kicks your ass so hard the boot comes out the other end, flies to your mom's house, and gets dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h3&gt;upcoming events&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;At &lt;time datetime="2025-08-26T11:00:00-05:00"&gt;11:00 a.m. EST&lt;/time&gt; tomorrow, something is gonna happen. I don't know. I can't come up with an example. Just imagine we're all going to take a siesta or something.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/main&gt;
		&lt;footer&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;copyright pipertext 2025&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/footer&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
			</code>

			<p>Now, you're probably saying, "holy shit dear webmaster, what is all of this magic and sorcery I have yet
				to be endowed with?" Do not fear, for at a second glance, it's
				all really quite self-explanatory.</p>

			<p>Let's first take a look at the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag. The head tag contains metadata about the
				page. Like I mentioned earlier, the webpage doesn't really display
				this data to the user (generally), but uses it to define what the webpage is or what resources it
				requires. In particular, take a look at the last two elements found within
				the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag. One references the stylesheet, and the other references a JavaScript
				file. The user will never see this information unless they
				fat-finger <code>Ctrl+Shift+I</code> or something, but they <em>will</em> certainly notice if the
				stylesheet didn't load.</p>

			<p>Now, to be fair, if you've looked at the middle two elements, the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element and
				first </code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element, you may have caught me
				in a lie... these two directly define data to be shown to the user. The difference is in the delivery
				method: let's take the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element for example;
				this information is not found <em>on</em> the webpage, opposed to to how something like
				<code>&lt;h1&gt;Put that in your pipe and smoke it!&lt;/h1&gt;</code> would. Instead,
				it is always displayed in a way the browser dictates, almost always as text on the tab representing the
				page.
			</p>

			<p>The top two <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags are just that: metadata. Really, if I had to guess, at least
				half of web developers would be unable to tell you what these
				lines truly mean. Code editors like Visual Studio Code will generally add them in for you when
				generating boilerplate code. UTF-8 is basically just a character set, so
				that tag is telling the browser to use it. The second <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag is honestly
				difficult to explain. Here's
				<a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/9y88xl/what_does_the_meta_nameviewport/'
					target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>a Reddit thread</a>
				where the purpose of the line was put into question. See, even I am part of that half! The smartest guy
				you know just showed you a shortcoming of his... just wow...
			</p>

			<h2>What practical purpose does this tool serve?</h2>

			<p>As I mentioned earlier, HTML wasn't intended to be such a widespread, necessary tool as it is today. But
				here we are, so learn to love it!</p>

			<p>HTML acts as the foundation of any website. Without HTML, there is no webpage. The same can't be said for
				CSS or JavaScript, the other two pillars of the web.
				HTML doesn't really define layout, that's the job of CSS, but it does define structure. For example,
				this heading belongs in this header, or this footer. Maybe
				this paragraph belongs in the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag, and that other one belongs in the
				<code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag. Good HTML practices basically allow
				your website to be read as though it's a newspaper when, for whatever bizarre reason, you don't have any
				CSS to help make it look pretty.
			</p>

			<h2>The essence of HTML</h2>

			<p>Getting familiar with HTML really will not take you long. Just reading this article probably is enough to
				get the gist; now when I tell you about the
				<code>&lt;content&gt;</code> element, you can probably have a vague idea of its function in your head.
