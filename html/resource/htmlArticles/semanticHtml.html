					<h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
				</div>
			</section>

			<p>The use of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML' target='_blank'
					rel='noopener noreferrer'>semantic HTML</a> is a relatively new concept. Semantic HTML is basically
				just HTML elements that are self-describing; a fine example is <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, which
				indicates that the content within is the primary content of the page. One of my personal favorites is
				the semi-elusive <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>, which indicates that the contained content is denoting a
				time of some sort, whether that be an exact date or just a certain time of the day.</p>

			<p>I belive it's important to get used to using semantic HTML early on. It'll become second nature before
				you know it, and there's no disadvantages to it. First, I'll go over what <em>non</em>-semantic HTML is.
			</p>

			<h2>Non-semantic HTML</h2>

			<p>Typically, websites don't use semantics. This is for a bunch of sorta crappy reasons outside the scope of
				this article, but there's two primary sticking points. The first one is that semantic HTML is relatively
				open-ended, as in, what content goes inside the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> element? Well, it could be a
				<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidebar_(computing)' target='_blank'
					rel='noopener noreferrer'>sidebar</a>, but it could also be used in the English sense where one
				might say something like 'as an aside'. The second reason, of which the merits are debatable, is that
				semantic HTML wasn't necessarily designed for all websites. Sure, it may work perfectly in an
				environment like Pipertext, but using those same elements on websites like Netflix may be more
				difficult. I look at this as a bit of an excuse, because even poorly designated semantic tags are better
				than a bunch on nondescript generic tags.</p>

			<p>When talking about elements that are not semantic, there's surprisingly only two of them. You're probably
				all like "holy shit, dearest webmaster! How can someone avoid using semantics in the first place, then?"
				Well, unfortunately, those two elements are the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
				elements, which act as completely generic boxes to place content in. <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags are
				used for blocks of content, such as a grid of images or a header/footer, while <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
				tags are for selecting certain pieces of text to give special stylings to. You can think of it like
				<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags; you can use the tags anywhere in a paragraph, or a header, or
				whatever, and any content inside will become <strong>bold</strong>.</p>

			<p>The problem is that, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> especially, is used en masse. Most web developers will
				think, "hey, I need a header," and then summon up a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> despite the perfectly
				useful and frankly gorgeous <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag sitting <em>right there</em>. In terms of
				the layout of your website, these two have no inherent difference. Browsers all treat these two the
				exact same way; in theory, you could use <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tags for <em>everything</em> you
				typically use <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags for. You may now be wondering what difference it makes, in
				that case.</p>

			<h2>Screen readers</h2>

			<p>Visually impaired individuals on the web don't have it easy as it is. Here's <a
					href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_ATY9gimOM' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>a
					decent example</a> of what using a screen reader is like. In essence, if you're unable to visually
				view a screen effectively, you'd use one of these; it reads off all activity for you. When you type a
				letter, it repeats it to you so you can be sure you typed the correct thing. When you tab over to an
				image, it reads the alternate text so you can get an idea of what it's depicting.</p>

			<p>Let's say you're using a screen reader, and you visit Pipertext. Your screenreader will say something
				like:</p>

			<blockquote class='codeBlock'>www.pipertext.net, five headings, thirteen links, and a header, nav, aside, main, and footer in that order. Pipertext.
			</blockquote>

			<p>That's pretty descriptive, and also very helpful. The user now knows of, and can navigate between, the
				header, and the footer, and the main content, and so forth with ease. What would it look like without
				semantics? Well:</p>

			<blockquote class='codeBlock'>www.pipertext.net, five headings, thirteen links. Pipertext.
			</blockquote>

			<p>It's the exact same thing, minus describing the semantics I would have been using in the first example.
				Now it feels like the user may be more lost; they only really have headings to make use of to navigate
				in an organized fashion, and even that is imperfect; web developers, myself included, are often unaware
				of the best practices for ordering various heading tags. Over the course of one's life, assuming they
				always need to make use of a screen reader, the addition of semantic elements will make their life on
				the web much easier, much more convenient, and probably also make them pretty happy knowing that the
				kind webmaster(s) decided to make use of elements which are there specifically to help them out.</p>

			<p><a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Inline-level_content' target='_blank'
					rel='noopener noreferrer'>Inline-level content</a> also benefits from semantic HTML, perhaps even
				more so. Say the user is reading about an upcoming event next week. A time and date is given. Sure, the
				screen reader can read off "this event is on oh-eight-slash-two-six-slash-two-zero-two-five, starting at
				oh-seven-three-zero AM", but using a <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element would tell the screen reader
				that, hey, this is a <em>time</em>, so pronounce it as such. Presumably, it would then read off "this
				event is on August twenty-sixth, starting at seven-thirty AM". Much easier to mentally parse.</p>

			<p>A short list of the most common semantic elements can be found at <a
					href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantic_elements' target='_blank'
					rel='noopener noreferrer'>MDN</a>, as well as listed below.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;details&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;figure&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;form&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;main&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;mark&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;summary&gt;</code></li>
				<li><code>&lt;time&gt;</code></li>
			</ul>

			<h2>How does the browser view semantics?</h2>

			<p>As I mentioned earlier, the browser is completely impartial to your tags, for the most part. Basically,
				everything the browser does in terms of styling prior to you adding in CSS is opinionated; as in, Chrome
				is going to be a bit different than Firefox. For most things, they'll probably be identical, like
				<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags will universally make text a certain amount bolder across all browsers.
				You'll see some differences in font styling and other default stuff, though. Hell, just checkout out
				this website of Firefox and then on Chrome or Edge. Browsers behave slightly differently, but I can
				assure you that, other than getting used to styling a bunch of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s, there is no
				difference to your workflow when encapsulating content in more descriptive and meaningful tags.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>

			<p>The usefulness of semantic HTML should not be understated. If you're a straight beginner, then starting
				off with semantics will build good habits right off the bat. If you're already well experienced, then I
				don't think it would take much effort to shoehorn semantics into your workflow. The value it provides to
				those with screenreaders is immense, and on top of that, your HTML looks so much prettier when it's a
				nice, even stack of elements which are self-descriptive rather than doing things like
				<code>class='header'</code>.</p>
