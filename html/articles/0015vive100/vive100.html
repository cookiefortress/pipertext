				<p>
					I have a penchant for energy drinks. If you read the <a
						href="/html/articles/0014packingLipsOfCoffee/packingLipsOfCoffee.html">article on Grinds coffee
						pouches</a>, you'll know that I made it clear that caffeine does nothing to me. Doesn't wake me
					up, doesn't relax me, nothing. Their unique flavor category is what draws me in; I <em>love</em> the
					taste commonly described as "battery acid". Personally, I've always seen energy drinks as a more
					refined form of soda. They typically have lighter carbonation and thus don't go flat like a typical
					soft drink.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nearby me, there's a huge international market that sells all sorts of weird shit that American
					minds likely have a hard time comprehending, like <a
						href="https://survivalgardenseeds.com/products/culinary-sage-seed-for-planting?variant=40245790015543&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">edible sage</a>. I didn't have a clue that was a thing
					until my most recent visit there. They also have a variety of energy drinks; some in a dedicated
					section with various soft drinks, some foreign from the US and some not, and some in the various
					nation-specific sections around the store. Vive 100% was found in the section dedicated to <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Mexico</a>.

				<h2>The bottle</h2>
				<p>Pictured above, the bottle resembles that of a sports drink more than a typical energy drink, in-line
					with Gatorade. Some energy drink companies in the US do have a history of trying to break into that
					market with products like Monster Hydro, as pictured adjacent to this paragraph. Currently, the only
					company that markets its products as "energy drinks" but also packages them in plastic bottles like
					that is Prime, one of the few energy drinks I've never actually had. Take a wild guess why I haven't
					raced to the nearest gas station to get myself a taste.</p>
				<p>The motto for the product seems to be <i><span lang="es">Energía para tu día a día</span></i>, which
					translates to "Energy for your day-to-day", found just below the "Vive 100% Energy" logo. The bottle
					obviously appears most sports drink-esque, but the company is clearly trying to market this more
					broadly. The bottle's visuals aren't really too interesting otherwise.</p>
				<p>
					The cap is truly strange. The picture shows the bottle already unwrapped, but the label goes around
					the green cap, which needs to be peeled off before taking off the lid. Interestingly, the green cap
					you see attached is <em>not</em> the actual cap; it is literally just a green cone that goes over
					the actual, more typical cap. As in, the green cone does not have threads on it, and can just be
					tossed after removal. Underneath of it is a standard water bottle cap that threads on and off. A
					gigantic waste of plastic.
				</p>
				<h2>The drink</h2>
				<p>
					As with most "original" energy drinks that don't list a specific flavor, it is very much in league
					with original Red Bull, Monster, and other originals. It's probably closest to Red Bull; it could be
					best described as a variation of it. Particularly, I'd say it's a bit less tart, and more sweet. A
					flavor that's hard to describe without tasting it for yourself, but if you've had Red Bull, and you
					liked it, then you'll like this.
				</p>
				<p>
					The company directly states, "Thanks to the combination of guaraná and tea extract, you get a
					sustained burst of energy." The caffeine is thus likely natural, which some prefer.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the web, I can see variations of this drink from Mexico and Colombia, but that's the extent of
					it. I'm unsure if it's sold in other Latin American countries, but I'm certain its sale doesn't
					extend past there. Other flavors like Borojó exist, but interestingly were not to be found at the
					market I went to. I imagine that original is the most popular flavor.
				</p>
				<h2>The nutrition facts</h2>
				<p>
					The nutrition facts are evidently a bit misleading on the sticker applied for the American market, pictured adjacent to this paragraph. I truly hate when they say there are six servings in a bottle like this; I doubt many people are drinking the bottle one sixth at a time throughout the week.

				<p>
					There's 30 grams total of sugar in it. It's low for a 16+ ounce energy drink, but you'll also notice that the ingredients list contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucralose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sucralose</a>. It's a very sweet energy drink; it uses sucralose to make up for the relatively low amount of sugar in the bottle. For comparison, 16 ounces of Monster (the original) has 54 grams of sugar. This bottle is 20.28 ounces and contains only 30 grams, yet maintains a very sweet taste.
				</p>
				<p>
					Slightly off-topic, but I really wish more energy drinks took this approach. 54 grams of sugar in one drink is a shit ton of sugar. On the other hand, I can immediately recognize sugar-free drinks when I have one, and it simply doesn't hit the same, and often yields a bitter aftertaste. Using less sugar and substituting another sweetener is quite literally the perfect middle ground. The only US market product I know that does this is <a href="https://www.monsterenergy.com/en-us/energy-drinks/monster-energy/lo-carb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monster Lo-Carb</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The caffeine content is around 200 milligrams a bottle. Not obvious just off the nutrition facts; you have to do some math. They're using at least four different food colorings, which seems a bit much for a product in a mostly non-opaque bottle.
				</p>
				<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
				<p>A solid drink that I probably wouldn't buy again, at least not in the near future. It's not good enough to warrant repeat purchases, but it's definitely something I could see someone preferring over Red Bull.</p>
