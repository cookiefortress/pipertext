            Yea yea, the <em>semantic web</em> is a modern idea! What's
            old-school about that?
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, I should first admit that I am a beginner at web development.
            I can make an okay static page... and that's about where my
            expertise ends. I want to get better of course, but I find myself
            really wanting to get the fundamentals down before I delve into
            anything beyond my feeble brain's capabilties.
          </p>
          <p>
            And fortunately for me, I find
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >HTML</a
            >
            and
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >CSS</a
            >
            alone to be a lot of fun, and really interesting. I suppose it's the
            opposite for most, but I like "handmade" stuff, especially really
            good "handmade" stuff. I have yet to really delve into frameworks
            and the like, but it seems to me it might take my enjoyment out of
            things a bit. Again, just a me thing. The creation of a webpage
            using only essential tooling is oddly satisfying to me. Plus... it's
            old-school. :-&rpar;
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe that explains why I find HTML interesting. So many tags, yet
            we choose to just <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> things up and call it a
            day. As of writing this post, there are
            <a
              href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener"
              >123~ tags</a
            >
            standardized in
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >HTML5</a
            >. This doesn't even include tags such as
            <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> (which Pipertext uses, if you haven't
            noticed) which are considered deprecated, albeit still often
            functional on most of the major browsers.
          </p>
          <h3>Why they're useful</h3>
          <p>
            First of all, inspect this page, open the
            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with a class of "container" and look at the
            stunning, beautiful, expertly-crafted layout. Hear that clapping
            coming from the other room? They just saw my layout too.
          </p>
          <p>
            But seriously, it's just so clean, so easy to navigate. Sure, that's
            largely chalked up to my use of
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_grid_layout"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >CSS grid</a
            >, but it's still just so much prettier to my eye than a bunch of
            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s with class names designated differently
            among developers. See, there's my footer, it's in the
            <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tag. Woah dude, where's your sidebar?!
            Well, it's in the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag, of course!
          </p>
          <p>
            Your CSS will be cleaner as a result as well. Just type
            <code>main &lcub;&rcub;</code> and you're good to go. I suppose it
            doesn't really matter if it's a codebase only <em>you</em> will be
            maintaining, but if everyone always wrote their HTML like this,
            maintaining other's work would probably become a million times
            easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of them are admittedly goofy and seem unnecessary. Take for
            instance the <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> tag, which is short for
            "definition element". It's supposed to represent a word that is to
            be defined within the context of some part of a page. I mean,
            cool... but is anyone actually going to remember to do that?
            Probably not. I would imagine tags like this <em>do</em> see their
            use in pages where accessibility is critical, however.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, semantic HTML is simply <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>ine!
