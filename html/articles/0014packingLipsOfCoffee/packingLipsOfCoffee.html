					After an unintentional 2-month+ hiatus, I return with gifts of Christmas cheer to bring Pipertext
					into its first holiday season. I have no excuse, just got a bit lazy and mostly preoccupied with
					classwork. The world shall rejoice at my return!
				</p>
				<p>
					I am by no means a "dipper"; but my love for tobacco doesn't really stop at pipes and cigars. Dip &
					chew are effectively a less complex and intimate form of pipe smoking for me. It's not something
					that comes close to a chamber of tobacco, but when society says no smoking indoors, methinks I'll
					throw in a wad!
				</p>
				<p>
					I understand fully that most people probably want nothing to do with tobacco, let alone gross
					dip/chew. The spitting is probably the dealbreaker for most, and it's kind of hard for me to argue
					with finding bottles of tobacco-infused saliva gross. Nonetheless, I find smokeless tobacco to be an
					effective means of satiating an oral fixation. Compared to something like gum, the flavor lasts
					<em>way</em> longer, and the flavor is far more intricate than any Extra I've ever chewed. What if
					you could replicate it without using tobacco?

				<h2>Grinds coffee pouches</h2>
				<p>
					Well, you can, but I'll start this off by saying they don't seem to be able to match the pleasure
					you can derive from tobacco. I'll also say that this has nothing to do with nicotine for me; I don't
					get a buzz from any tobacco products, nor do I feel dependant on it. The alternatives simply do not
					fare well in any department when they're standing against the might of Copenhagen.
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.getgrinds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grinds coffee pouches</a> have always been the go-to tobacco alternative for me. In high school, me and
					my friends would buy it, obviously given we couldn't purchase dip (the legal age for purchasing
					tobacco products went up to 21 from 18 in 2017). That's not to say this was an everyday purchase for
					us, but something we bought as a novelty hold-over until we could get the real shit.
				</p>
				<p>
					I picked up a can of spearmint today and figured I'd give my thoughts here. Or maybe it was just an
					excuse to put my S-tier photography skills to use.
				</p>
				<h2>The can</h2>
				<p>
					The can is adequate; nothing to write home about, but it certainly isn't going to fall apart on you.
					It resembles your average <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">snus</a> can more than a can of dip, primarily because
					they are plastic, both the can itself and the lid, as well as the fact that there is a <i>catch
						lid</i>. A catch lid, pictured adjacent to this paragraph, is simply another lid on the top of
					the can's primary lid that pops off and can be used to get rid of used portions. Kinda gnarly if you
					think about it. I guess they had to capture the grossness factor of dip somehow!
				<figure class="standardCard">
					<img src="/html/articles/0014packingLipsOfCoffee/spearmintCan2.jpeg"
						alt="A picture of a 'no smoking' sign in Counter-Strike 1.6" style="max-width: 18rem;">
					<figcaption>
						The Grinds can with the catch lid off
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				</p>
				<p>
					The can itself is pretty durable, and I do not see the need to worry about the lid popping off in
					your pocket if you're doing a lot of moving throughout the day. It fits on snugly and also comes off
					with ease.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dip cans by brands like <a href="https://smokeless-tobacco.fandom.com/wiki/Longhorn" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Longhorn</a> tend to have lids that literally taco up. As in, if you
					remove the lid and squeeze it, it will bend into the shape of a taco. The lid for this does not,
					hence why I don't see this coming off in your pocket accidentally.
				</p>
				<p>
					In case you've never cracked open a can of dip/dip alternative, you run a fingernail across the
					diameter of can just under the lid. Doing this wasn't hard for me, and I keep short fingernails. The
					band feels more like paper than rubber, and could probably be cut with light pressure from a pocket
					knife if you don't want to use your nails.
				</p>
				<h2>Opening the can</h2>
				<p>
					You're immediately greeted with a scent that is practically exactly 50/50 coffee and spearmint when
					opening the can. Both of these are pretty much as stereotypical and unimaginative as you can
					possibly imagine. That's not to say that's bad, but to say that you shouldn't be expecting anything
					akin to divine revelation. The coffee note is honestly nice, and the spearmint is just as you'd find
					in a pack of gum.
				<figure class="standardCard">
					<img src="/html/articles/0014packingLipsOfCoffee/spearmintCanOpen.jpeg"
						alt="The Grinds can with the lid off" style="max-width: 18rem;">
					<figcaption>

				</figure>
				</p>
				<p>
					The pouches themselves are <em>thick</em>. Compared to a dip pouch, they feel very full and plump.
					Then again, I imagine loading up these pouches with coffee grinds is <em>far</em> cheaper than
					tobacco. I'd be shocked if the product inside costed them more than $0.50to produce. Regardless,
					they are thick, thick enough that you won't forget it's there like you might some snus pouches, or
					better yet, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_pouch" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">nicotine pouches</a>. Those things are tiny. And lame.
				</p>
				<p>
					The pouches are also extremely dry. Bone dry; I believe the company itself recommends not placing
					directly by your gums, but rather throwing it on your tongue and placing that way because it
					introduces moisture to the pouch. They're dry in the can as it supposedly preserves flavor and helps
					the product to gradually "activate" in the mouth, but I think that's all marketing jibber jabber. A
					little moisture wouldn't hurt, but it probably doesn't matter either way.
				</p>
				<p>
					In terms of appearance, they do look a lot like dip pouches. Especially after ridding of them into
					the trash can; maybe don't let momma see them in there...
				</p>
				<h2>Flavor & texture</h2>
				<p>
					Because of the pouches' dry nature, the texture is a bit odd entering your mouth assuming you're
					used to dip pouches. Once it moistens up, it still has its own thing going on; it's a lot firmer
					than a dip pouch. Dip pouches don't really firm up in the mouth; they do form to your gums, but they
					stay flimsy from before use to after. These Grinds are the opposite: consistently very firm.
				<figure class="standardCard">

						alt="The Grinds can with the lid off at a different angle" style="max-width: 18rem;">

				</p>
				<p>
					The flavor is almost exactly as it smells, but the spearmint is more dominant than the coffee,
					as opposed to the aroma which feels like an even combination of both. However, the longer the
					product was in my mouth, the more of a coffee note I got. Prior to writing this, I used three of
					these pouches, keeping them in for 35-45 minutes each time. The flavor lasted the whole time, albeit
					was considerably stronger at the beginning, and the spearmint is borderline overwhelming at first. Not because it's spicy/sour, but the flavor is just very strong and in-your-face. This dies down quickly though, within the first couple of minutes.
				</p>
				<p>
					I find the mixture of coffee with spearmint to be not my taste. Not that it's bad, but it simply is not something I enjoy. The best Grinds flavors, to me, are the ones that stay true to the coffee grinds gimmick. I.e., the <a href="https://www.getgrinds.com/products/double-mocha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Double Mocha</a> ones. Strangely, I do like coffee that is flavored with different things like pumpkin spice, but it just doesn't work for me when it comes to Grinds. The flavor also gets old really fast, even if I don't mind it at first.
				</p>
				<p>
					I can't speak to what gum it might resemble the most, but it's pretty in-line with any spearmint-flavored gum I've ever had. Some brands of dip have spearmint flavors, such as <a href="https://smokeless-tobacco.fandom.com/wiki/Skoal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skoal</a>, but I haven't had the pleasure of trying them.
				</p>
				<h2>Caffeine buzz</h2>
				<p>
					I don't get any reaction from caffeine either; historically, I have enjoyed two tall energy drinks just before bedtime without any plight. I can't speak to the buzz this could provide to someone who is energized by caffeine, but do keep in mind they have only a fraction (basically a third) of <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11314177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the caffeine a typical cup of coffee contains</a> (82.5mg). Monster energy drinks contain around 160mg for a 16oz can. If you already use caffeine in some capacity, I doubt these would do anything for you unless you threw in two at a time, and even then, you're well below that of an actual cup of coffee.
				</p>
				<p>
					Grinds does make products with much higher caffeine contents, such as <a href="https://www.getgrinds.com/products/red-eye-espresso" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these</a>, coming in at 100mg. I imagine they don't typically do this with all their flavors because it's generally recommended to limit yourself to 400mg a day <em>at the most</em>; that means it would become unsafe to use more than four of those in a day.
				</p>
				<h2>Comparison to dip</h2>
				<p>
					To me, there is no competition here. They have less nuanced flavor, are shorter lasting, and generally get old after the first few uses. I'm not someone that actively enjoys the act of spitting with oral tobacco products, so that is certainly a plus, but at that rate you may as well use snus. As a means of avoiding tobacco, they're okay, and I still have many more flavors to try, but I have to imagine there's more flavorful options out there. <a href="https://smokeysnuff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smokey Mountain</a> is an example of one with some potential, albeit many of their products do not contain caffeine.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem with using these as a substitute for tobacco is that it's not tobacco, if that makes sense. I'm not educated enough to say for sure, but there must be some property of tobacco that allows it to administer strong flavor consistently. That, and the intrinsic flavor and even mouth-feel of tobacco is irreplacable by coffee grounds.
				</p>
				<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
				<p>
					I like them enough, but I think I'd like them more in other flavors. More coffee-oriented flavors seem to where they work best, combined with the fact I love the taste/smell of coffee.
				</p>
				<p>
					I will make a point to try more flavors in the future and let my thoughts be known to the world. Perhaps this flavor is just not the one that speaks to me.
