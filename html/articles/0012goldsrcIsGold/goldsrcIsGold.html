					Well, it's almost 3:00 AM on a fine Saturday night/Sunday morning, and I'm bored as shit! So, I
					figured I'd start on a little blog post about my favorite thing in the world: <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldSrc" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldsrc</a> graphics! What's that you say? I'm blinded by nostalgia?
					Well, screw you, man, I wasn't alive even when <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a> was released!
				</p>
				<h2>Lo-fi lust</h2>
				<p>
					I've noticed there's a pattern for things I have a keen interest for. They're old, or stylistically
					old, and they give off a 'primitive' feeling. A good example is music: I adore black metal. Give <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathory_(album)" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Bathory</a> a listen for what I see as a perfect example.
					Intentionally recorded in a way which shows minimal care for polish, it just exudes a feeling I am
					honestly having trouble describing in words. It's like the primitive nature yields a more personal
					touch, to me, like the artist can 'speak' to the audience more authentically.

						Well, shit...
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				</p>
				<p>
					Likewise, this translates into the aesthetics of 3D video games in their youth. The <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo 64</a> is a bastion for games with <em>perfect</em> graphics
					for me. I don't mean to try to be not like the other girls, but this seems to bring dismay to
					others. Genuine confusion as to why one would prefer it. But why? This logic is applied to
					<em>nothing</em> else: music, movies and TV shows, artwork, architectural styles, and shit, even
					technology! It's strange to me that games are seemingly viewed as a cycle games becoming 'obsolete'
					upon the release of new stuff, even when the same standards isn't held for other mediums of games
					like board games or even sports. I digress... for now.

				<h2>Goldsrc gamin'</h2>
				<p>
					I was introduced to Goldsrc via a Steam Sale when I was around thirteen years old. I'm really not
					even sure how I came across it, but if I had to guess, I was looking into buying Portal and found
					that I may as well purchase the <a
						href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/232/Valve_Complete_Pack/" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve Complete Pack</a> for what was around $20. I should note that,
					before this, I had been interested in old video games since I was probably nine or ten years old.
					One of the first big Christmas gifts I remember was a <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sega
						Genesis</a>. Thus, it wasn't particularly out of left field for me to then fixate on some of the
					older offerings found within that bundle.

				</p>
				<p>
					I believe what initially caught my eye was <a
						href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/20/Team_Fortress_Classic/" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Fortress Classic</a>. Me and some friends had already been
					playing a fair bit of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Fortress 2</a>, and I probably hadn't even ever
					considered what the <em>first</em> iteration of Team Fortress looked like. But then I saw that Valve
					had a fairly extensive collection of visually similar games. This is probably where my fascination
					with the 3D visuals of the time was born, as prior to this I was mostly interested in more
					stereotypical retro games. As per the Sega Genesis I got for Christmas.
				</p>
				<p>
					Goldsrc in particular has a very homely feeling to it. Not only due to the simple yet effective
					graphics, but the sound effects. The way players move. The janky animations for reloading; and the
					idle animations when you give your CV-47 a light tap. Despite my lack of any sort of nostalgia here,
					I've always felt this way about it. To me, the distinct visuals is preferential to modern attempts
					at making things look as realistic as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					I honestly recommend just booting up a game like <a
						href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/40/Deathmatch_Classic/" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Deathmatch Classic</a>, joining a server where you can get a decent
					ping, and jumping around. <a href="/media/img/p_se_3.png" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's a screenshot off of the map <code>p_se_3</code></a>. To some,
					it's a lame picture from an obscure video game which is twenty-five years old; to me, it's a a
					masterpiece in liminality. It makes me feel weird inside, almost as if I'm at home, yet there's
					something to be explored.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you couldn't tell, I had no real direction for this article. I just wanted to spout on about my
					favorite graphical aesthetic. No need to fret, however. I will be giving you my thoughts on this a million times more in the future.
