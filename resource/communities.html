                Neocities is a modern recreation of what

                once was, before it closed in 2009. Geocities was a web hosting
                service where users could make an account and upload their own
                websites, for free! A lot of people had accounts with them in
                the 90s and early 2000s, and the company largely made money via
                plastering advertisements on the user-created sites. Neocities
                does <em>not</em> do this,allowing you to upload your site for
                free with no ads! You can pay for a premium service where you
                can add custom domains and some other stuff, but it's entirely
                superfluous if you just want to make a cool little site. I
                recommend giving some of the most popular pages a browse!

                Nekoweb is very similar to Neocities. Lots of overlap in
                userbases, and they both serve a very similar purpose. There's a
                weird thing with them hating on Neocities for whatever reason,
                but it seems constrained to some small portion of the userbase.
                Most people on here are cool and friendly!

                FARK is an old-as-shit forum for discussing humorous current
                events. It's kinda weird, and its culture doesn't necessarily
                revolve around Web 1.0 stuff, but I would imagine the people
                active on there have been around for a decade or two.
