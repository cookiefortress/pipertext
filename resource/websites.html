                A website with a lottt of really neat resources and guides on
                webmastery! The site has a really cool aesthetic, it's
                unfortunate the creator has seemingly stepped away from web
                development. I highly recommend you at <em>least</em> check out

                Texture Town is a Neocities site that has a bunch of cool
                textures that you can use not only on websites but also in 3D
                games/environments. Some of them fit the bill a bit better for
                web design, others more for 3D stuff. Really cool website
                design, too!

                Not necessarily old-school, but some of the patterns here work
                really well with Web 1.0 designs.

                Wiby is really neat; it indexes the Web only for pages that use
                nothing but HTML and CSS. Of course, that would take out sites
                like Pipertext that use JavaScript, so you'll miss out on some
                real goodies! Especially Pipertext! It's really fun to mess
                around with, though.

                Angelfire! There's a lot here, but you'll find some absolute

                owns Netscape and has released a Netscape browser (in name only)
                which is Chromium-based. I'm linking the site as I like the
                design; it has a weird middle ground between modern and early
                2000s commercial designs. I honestly wonder if the browser is
                anything cool, I've never tried it.

                has a list of every website made prior to 1995. These were
                obviously a bit few and far between, so this list is pretty
                exhaustive, and really not too long. You can look through it and
                do a bit of digging to uncover what some of them looked like. A
                lot of them were mostly plain hypertext.
